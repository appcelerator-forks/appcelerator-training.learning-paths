# Principles of UI/UX Design

--- 

# You are Married to your Mobile

- Mobile computing is fundamentally different than desktop/laptop
- Design for real mobile interfaces (voice, messaging, location...)
- Users take their mobile devices everywhere
- People's identities are wrapped up in their mobile devices

# Hardware

- Mobile hardware is confined by nature
- Freedom in the framework
- Target 'lowest common' hardware

--- 

# Screens

- Size and density variations
- But that's an opportunity
- Target your primary consumers, accommodate your secondary consumers
- Don't design once, use everywhere

--- 

# Mobile Challenges

- Handset usage: One-handed, on the go
- Tablet usage: Two-handed, lean-back
- Users can, and do rotate their devices for various reasons
- Plan for abandon

--- 

# Sketch It!
