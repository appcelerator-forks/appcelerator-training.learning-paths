# Titanium SDK - ARCHITECTURE

---

# How Titanium SDK Works

- You write Javascript
- Appcelerator maps your JavaScript code to native components
- Communication is two-way across the bridge

![ACS](/assets/image25.png)

--- 

# Appcelerator Key Points

- You write in JavaScript
- There's a platform-specific bridge and set of native components(so your source code can run on multiple platforms)
- Your JavaScript is still there and running on the user's device
- Your app is compiled (so your code is secure)

--- 

# Cross-Platform in Appcelerator

- Cross-platform !== 'Write Once, Run Everywhere‘
- Titanium is 'Write Once, Adapt Everywhere‘
- Goal is to build 'Best of Breed' apps
- Non-visual code up to 100% portable
- Accept and embrace platform differences

--- 

# Appcelerator Provides APIs For:

- UI components — add native buttons, pickers, tables and more to your apps
- Networking — HTTP/HTTPS, sockets, Bonjour
- Local storage — file, database, app properties
- Camera, GPS, accelerometer
- Social APIs — Facebook, YQL, more
- Extensible & modular to add on custom functionality

# DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
--- 

# App Dev Process

- Write your source in JavaScript
- Build for simulator/emulator/test device
- Debug/test
- Publish

--- 

# Build Process

- Node.js scripts analyze your JavaScript and interact with native tools
- Your code is packaged into native project
- Platform-specific interpreter included
  - iOS: JavaScriptCore
  - Android: V8
- Native project is compiled using platform-specific tools
- If building to device, project is code-signed using native tools

--- 

# Debugging/Testing Overview

- Syntax checking in Studio
- Logging messages
- Breakpoint debugging in simulator/emulator and device
- Native tools for memory inspection
- Appcelerator Performance Management service
- Appcelerator Test for automated functional testing

--- 

# Publishing Overview

- Your code is minified and further compiled than with development builds
- Images are optimized with a pngCrush style optimizer
- App is signed with your publication certificates
- Stored on the file system (Android) or synced to Xcode Organizer (iOS) for native publishing process(AdHoc & Enterprise publishing a bit different)
